The Forge is a multi-agent AI system built on Langchain in Python that uses natural language input to generate fully functional software. The project is a personal experiment to see if Langchain and Agentic AI in general has reached a point where anyone can make AI agents that can build production quality sofware autonomously.

## 🌟 What Makes The Forge Special?

Unlike chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude that provide single responses, The Forge uses **Agentic AI**— specialized AI agents that collaborate, reason, and execute complex workflows. This is a major advaancement from conversational AI to **action-oriented AI systems**. Most commercially available AI is capable of this, but the owners intentionally block this.

### What's the difference between Chatbot vs Agentic AI

| Traditional Chatbots | Agentic AI (The Forge) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Single response per query | Multi-step autonomous execution |
| Stateless conversations | Persistent state and memory |
| Text output only | Creates files, runs code, tests |
| Human drives all actions | AI agents make decisions |
| Limited problem-solving | Complex workflow orchestration |

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Forge consists of four specialized AI agents working together:

### Agent Roles

1. **🧠 Planner Agent (Architect)**: Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to create detailed project plans
2. **⚙️ Code Generator Agent**: Executes the plan by creating files, directories, and installing dependencies
3. **🧪 Test Engineer Agent**: Runs automated tests to verify code quality
4. **🔧 Debugger Agent**: Analyzes failures and provides recommendations for fixes

## 🚀 Human/AI generated work product

Agentic AI systems like The Forge represent the future of human-computer collaboration:

- **Autonomous Problem Solving**: Agents can break down complex tasks and solve them step-by-step
- **Persistent Memory**: Unlike chatbots, agents maintain context across multiple interactions
- **Tool Usage**: Agents can use external tools, APIs, and systems to accomplish goals
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multiple agents with specialized skills work together
- **Continuous Learning**: Through RAG, agents access and utilize vast knowledge bases

This enables scenarios impossible with traditional chatbots:
- "Build me a web application" → Complete working app with tests
- "Debug this error" → Automated analysis and fix suggestions
- "Optimize my code" → Performance analysis and improvements

### Step 4: Additional Setup

#### Tesseract OCR (for image processing)
The Forge can extract text from images in your knowledge base.

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
# Or use chocolatey
choco install tesseract
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

#### OpenAI API Key
1. Sign up at: https://platform.openai.com/
2. Create an API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Knowledge Base (Optional)

Create a `knowledge/` directory and add documentation:
```bash
mkdir knowledge
# Add PDF files, markdown documentation, images, etc.
```

Run the ingestion script to create the vector database:
```bash
python ingestion.py
```

### Step 2: Start MCP Servers

The Forge uses Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers for file operations and shell commands.

**Terminal 1 - Filesystem Server:**
```bash
python mcp/mcp_server_filesystem.py
```
*Runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000*

**Terminal 2 - Shell Server:**
```bash
python mcp/mcp_server_shell.py
```
*Runs on http://127.0.0.1:8001*

### Step 3: Run The Forge

**Terminal 3 - Main Application:**
```bash
python main.py "create a simple calculator app with tests"
```

### Step 4: Interact with the System

1. The **Planner Agent** will analyze your request and create a plan
2. **Human Review** will show you the plan - type 'y' to approve
3. The **Code Generator** will execute each step
4. If tests fail, the **Debugger** will analyze and suggest fixes

## 💡 Example Use Cases

```bash
# Web Development
python main.py "create a Flask blog application with user authentication"

# Data Science
python main.py "build a data analysis tool for CSV files with visualizations"

# Game Development
python main.py "create a text-based RPG game with character classes"

# API Development
python main.py "build a REST API for a task management system"

# Machine Learning
python main.py "create a sentiment analysis model with training data"
```

## 🧠 Understanding LangChain

**LangChain** (https://python.langchain.com/) is the foundational framework powering The Forge. It provides:

### Key Components Used in The Forge:

1. **Language Models**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT models
2. **Prompt Templates**: Structured prompts for consistent AI behavior
3. **Chains**: Sequences of LLM calls and data transformations
4. **Agents**: AI systems that can use tools and make decisions
5. **Memory**: Persistent conversation and context storage
6. **Vector Stores**: Efficient similarity search for RAG
7. **Document Loaders**: Processing various file formats

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

The Forge implements RAG to enhance the Planner Agent:

```python
# Simplified RAG workflow
knowledge_base = load_vector_store()
relevant_docs = knowledge_base.search(user_query)
enhanced_prompt = f"Context: {relevant_docs}\nTask: {user_query}"
plan = llm.generate(enhanced_prompt)
```

This allows the AI to access domain-specific knowledge beyond its training data.

## 🔮 The Future of Agentic AI

The Forge represents just the beginning of what's possible with agentic AI systems:

### Current Capabilities:
